<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there, my name is Harrison Leitch. I am 21 years old and I am very passionate about buildings things, understanding how things work and bringing ideas / concepts to life. I currently work as a gerneral builder, as a bit of a break from studying and passing my electrical diplomas at college. </p>

<p>I have spent the past four years at college studying to become an electrician, but as each year passed I grew less and less interested in becoming a tradesman. I started creating basic websites as a bit of fun out of work using wix website creator, shopify and webador. I was always dissapointed with how little customisation opportunities these large web developer sites offer. Some of my ideas that i wanted to create could simply not be done using these sites. So, I started to research web development and began creating my own ideas which i found incredibly fun. </p>
